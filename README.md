## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This game mod (modification or module) is created for the BG2:SoA side of a BG2:ToB game (yes, BG2:ToB is required), as many people wouldn't want to go through a whole new game to reach ToB areas just to play this mod. With that in mind, most people who have played BG2 know that one of the plot quests is to save the village/town of Trademeet from evil druids, Calim rakshasa, and the noble bickerings. "*Shadows Over Soubar*" picks up just after that. However, action in the mod does occur if you do not complete the entire sequence of quests in Trademeet, beginning directly after Imoen is kidnapped by the Cowls and Irenicus.

We know that war is brewing in Tethyr, and that the Sword Coast has experienced troubles since our hero left Candlekeep as a young adventurer. Power groups- the Iron Throne in particular- have been destroyed, and others are quick to grab for their own power. Including such enemies as Yaga-Sura, Melissan, and Irenicus. But there are other less twisted enemies that prey not on heroes, but on the simple folk. Folk who's only crime is that they live in a town where a great leader who met an orcan horde on the field of battle once lived. Farmers, herders, tradesmen, and merchants all are affected by those who claim power over their lives. Now that sounds like a call for help! Which our great hero will answer. To the rescue we go!

So our story begins in Trademeet, where our hero learns that some mysterious men from the north are looking for them. What those men want, we are not sure. But after a time of searching Amn, our great hero finds a sneaky thief who '*employs*' us to do some '*work*'. After completing the jobs, the sneaky thief will finally tell our hero what needs to be done to move on. And our hero does indeed move on, finding some letters which leads them to the mysterious men. These mysterious men will explain the entire situation, and the hero can accept (continue the mod) or decline to help.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

Shadows over Soubar is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/195-shadows-over-soubar/">report them on the forum</a>!

>Classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-sos.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **sos** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Shadows over Soubar for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: sos folder and a setup-sos.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-sos.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-sos.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Shadows over Soubar for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: sos folder, setup-sos and setup-sos.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-sos.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-sos.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Shadows over Soubar for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-sos`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-sos --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component *DESIGNATED* number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components and mods detect it and allows automated installers to specify component choices.  
All optional components require the main component (they need to since it's the one that installs new content).<br /><br />


#### 0. Main component

This component installs the mod itself.</br>

## 

#### 1. Selence arrives to Waukeens Promenade after the meeting with Gaelan in the slums

This component requires the main component to be installed.</br>

## 

#### 2. Remorhaz walking speed adjustment (for ENGLISH version .EXE ONLY!!!)

This component requires the main component to be installed. It patches BGmain.exe to reduce MBRH moving speed.</br>
:warning: **WARNING!** It is only valid for an ENGLISH version, for non-EE games and for non-Mac OS.</br></br>

	14. Unused WAVs removed from ALORA, KIVAN and ELDOTH soundsets. The creatures that use them are not joinable NPCs, so they won't use any sound beside 01,03,07,11,17-19,38,39. 
	15. Missed FLAMN and several other (for creatures soundsets) WAVs added.
